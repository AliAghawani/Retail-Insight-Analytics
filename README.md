# Retail Insight Analytics ‚≠ê

## Project Overview üìù
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail performance by focusing on two key aspects of the business:
- **Retail Sales:** Analyze various metrics to measure sales revenue and business efficiency.
- **Retail Costs:** Evaluate the different costs associated with the business (such as wages and rent) and compare them against internal sales targets and KPIs.

**Data Preparation:**  
Data cleaning and transformation were performed using **Power Query** to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This step involved removing duplicate records, standardizing formats, and enriching data with date information for dynamic time-based slicing and filtering.

## Project Structure üìä
- **Sales Report Page:** Visualizations that offer insights into overall sales performance across months, categories, and stores over the period 2020-2022.
- **Cost & Target Report Page:** Analysis comparing cost structure with set sales targets for an in-depth view of retail expenses and performance.
- **Shared Dashboard:** A consolidated view combining key metrics from both report pages for an at-a-glance understanding of retail performance.

## Features üöÄ
- **Detailed Sales Analysis:** Breakdown of monthly, categorical, and store-specific sales data over three years.
- **Cost and Target Comparison:** In-depth examination of internal cost metrics against sales targets.
- **Store Performance Insight:** Geographic and categorical analysis to pinpoint high-performing locations and departments.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic filters for time periods, locations, and categories that let you explore the data on your terms.
